# todo-app
This Todo application is made in Python. It's a simple program that I've made from what I've learned from school and some Python courses. 
It's minimalistic and have simple functions like add a new todo and delete a todo. 
I'm using Streamlit, which is a Python library, to display the app as a web app.
