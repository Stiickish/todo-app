# todo-app
This Todo application is made in Python. It's a simple program that I've made from what I've learned from school and some Python courses. 
It's minimalistic and have simple functions like add a new todo and delete a todo. 
I'm using Streamlit, which is a Python library, to display the app as a web app. 
To use the app, download or clone the project. Install the requirements with pip install in your terminal. 
To run the application type in : streamlit run web.py. The app will then open the application as a localhost app in your browser.
